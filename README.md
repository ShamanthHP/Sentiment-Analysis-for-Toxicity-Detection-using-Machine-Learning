# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Toxicity-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
- Sentimental analysis using Machine Learning

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model aimed at detecting the toxicity of statements using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging tools like PyCharm and Python, I implemented a Random Forest Classifier combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze textual data.

Key features of the project include:

Toxicity Detection: The model accurately identifies and classifies the toxicity level of statements.
Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the model is rigorously evaluated using accuracy, precision, and F1 score.
Data Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations are created to interpret the data and the model's predictions effectively.
This project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and my ability to apply these skills to real-world problems.
